# Project #3: Full Stack Application (SEI x UXDI)

## Overview:

Your team will be creating a full stack application for UXDI Strudents!

**You will be working as a team for this project**, everyone must contribute.  If 1 person does not contribute or 1 person does all the work then the entire team will fail the project requirements.  If you pair program then please include the other persons github name in the commit.

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a web application in a managed hosting environment.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **SQL**: SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
- **AJAX**: Using Axios to make asynchronous javascript calls.
- **APIs**: Communicating to an API using Axios to fetch data.
- **Node**: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- **NPM**: A package manager for Node.js packages, or modules 
- **React**: A front end framework for building modern web applications.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Mongodb**: A cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
- **Mongoose**: Provides a schema-based solution for object modeling with Node.js to model your Mongodb data.
- **JSON APIs**: JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, easy and popular way to exchange data. A backend REST service to deliver some data in JSON format to the front-end application.

## Requirements

### Option A: SEI x UXDI

- **Build a full stack web application**.  Must be your own work.
- **[Select a Project Idea of your own](badir-projects.md)**.  Must at least have User Authentication and CRUD on a resource.
- **Use technology stack templates**.  You may choose which tech stack.
  - [Rails Template](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/rails-template)
  - [Rails API Template](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/rails-api-template) with [React Template](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/react-template)
  - [Express API Template](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/express-api-template) with [React Template](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/react-template)
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the Badir team for further development.

### Necessary Deliverables

Projects are due **Thursday, 1/8 at 10am**!  

Submissions will be submitted by posting into slack
- a link to your deployed application 
- a link to your github repository

The presentation must be a **8-10 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the application about?
  - What are the user stories for your application?
  - What API did you choose to use?
  - Demo of the application
  - Walk through a piece of code
  - What was the most difficult part of the project?
  - What was your favorite part of the project
  - What would your team like to add next?
